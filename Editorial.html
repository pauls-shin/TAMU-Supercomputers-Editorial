        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
            FASTER, an acronym for Fostering Accelerated Scientific Transformations, Education and Research,
            is a supercomputer located at Texas A&M University developed for the growing needs of higher-performance 
            computing. This supercomputer runs on a Linux (CentOS 8) operating system and has 180 64-core compute nodes,
            each with 256GB of RAM. At peak performance, these specs allow the supercomputer to perform 
            1,200,000,000,000,000 floating-point operations per second (1.2 petaflops). The supercomputer
            also uses Lustre, a file system for high-performance computing, for managing up to 5,000,000 GB
            (5 petabytes) of storage space on the global disk.

        <h3>Security & Access</h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
            Texas A&M, specifically the High Performance Research Computing (HPRC), has a strict policy on security to
            maintain its level of protection against unauthorized access, sensitive data, and the system’s integrity. 
            Access to FASTER is only given out by the HPRC team. The HPRC team requires users wanting access to submit
            proposals on their research goals and computing requirements. If approved, the then authorized user is 
            required to attend sessions where they are trained on the best system’s policies and best practices for
            data management and security. After this, users must have a secure password and two-factor authentication
            (Duo) enabled to use FASTER. All activity from the user while on FASTER is tracked by the High Performance
            Research Computing department.

      <section id="faster3">
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
          In the overview, we briefly covered the components that make up the FASTER supercomputer. In this subsection,
          we will take a look at the entire specs of the supercomputer. Take a look at the table below.
          <!--NEED TO INSERT MY PIC HERE-->
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
          At first look at the table above we can see that the supercomputer operates on Linux, specifically through 
          the CentOS 8 distribution. Also looking at the compute nodes and composable GPUs that FASTER contains, we 
          can see that at peak performance, FASTER will outperform Tera(377 Teraflops) but be outperformed by Grace(6.3 Petaflops).
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
          Although some may speculate that just based on these comparisons one is always better than the other when it comes to
          performance. This is not the case though. FASTER, with the help of the InfiniBand network and sizable and fast storage
          processing speeds, is perfectly optimized for parallel simulations such as those done in material science and engineering
          simulations. In terms of areas where FASTER lacks due to hardware, we can see that the smaller number and power of memory
          and GPU can fall behind in categories relating to machine learning or scientific computing such as molecular and fluid 
          dynamics where otherwise, Tera and Grace would shine.  Therefore, it is less about comparisons of computing power and
          rather more about the type of resource you need for the specific task at hand.
        </p>

      <section id="faster4">
        <h3>File System Architecture</h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
            FASTER makes use of Lustre’s file system, which is able to manage FASTER’s multiple parallel file systems. Lustre’s
            parallel filing system is known to provide very efficient and fast data-sharing across multiple nodes (processors).
            Also within each compute node on FASTER, there is a local scratch file system implemented (which is faster than Lustre).
            The downfall of the scratch file system is that it has limited storage and can not be shared between each node. Therefore, 
            the main use case for the scratch file system stored on each node is for temporary data storage during simulations in progress 
            (kind of like Random Access Memory).
          </p>
          <!--NEED TO INSERT MY PIC HERE-->
          <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
            When it comes to the data storage system that FASTER has in place for its large storage capacity (5 Petaflops), Hierarchical
            Storage Management is used. Hierarchical Storage Management is a data storage manipulation system that optimizes by placing
            the most frequently accessed data on the faster storage modules. On the other hand, the less frequently accessed data is
            placed on the slower storage modules. The reason that the Hierarchical Storage Management is great for FASTER’s infrastructure
            is due to not only cost efficiency but also maintaining computing efficiency. 
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
            Overall, the file system infrastructure that FASTER makes use of seems to be designed to maintain high performance across data
            sharing (between nodes) while working with larger data sets. The combination of all features such as the Lustre file system,
            the scratch file system, and the Hierarchical Storage Management work synonymously to keep storage costs efficient while not
            sacrificing much parallel computing capabilities in simulations requiring large data analysis pools. 
          </p>

      <section id="faster5">
        <h3>Batch Processing</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
          FASTER allows Batch Processing through the use of Slurm, a workload manager that allows the allocation of resources to specific jobs
          and queuing and viewing of these jobs as well. FASTER’s Slurm is designed with multiple partitions for use cases such as general use,
          development use, and GPU-intensive use. The existence of a system like Slurm for batch processing in FASTER allows experienced users
          to manage and allocate resources from the machine's resource pool.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
          After researching supercomputers and FASTER in specific, I’ve learned that supercomputers require more than just large amounts of expensive
          hardware to be used at their full potential. Factors like the structuring of the file system architecture, batch processing, and interconnections
          are key components that allow the FASTER supercomputer to excel in parallel computing. The intricate designs down to assigning each node, memory,
          and storage module with specific use cases make the infrastructure of this system fascinating.
